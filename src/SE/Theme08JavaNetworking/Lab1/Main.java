 * 1) Create a Student class with private fields: String name, String course, int id.
 *      Add getters and setters to Student class. Override the toString() method. <p>
 *
 * 2) Create a MyClient class, which receives a Student's instance and sends it to the server via a socket connection,
 *      and then receives and outputs the server's response.
 *      You can implement this class as a separate thread. <p>
 *
 * 3) Create a MyServer class, which establishes a socket connection with the client,
 *      and then outputs the received information, and sends the response to the client.
 *      You can implement this class as a separate thread. <p>
 *
 * 4) Create a Main class with a main() method, which creates an instance of the class Student
 *      and runs the threads of server and of client on execution.
